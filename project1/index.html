                <h3>PSP-1000 "FAT"</h3>
                <p>The first PSP. A very common system, although likely just as common as its successor model. Being Sony's first crack into the portable market, the fact that the PSP-1000 has some downsides isn't surprising. Mainly, the PSP-1000 suffers from having 32 MB of RAM instead of 64 MB (resulting in slow UMD loading times), a bulkier shell (which some may prefer), supposedly poorer button quality, a less vibrant and green-ish screen, and a faulty WLAN module which is easily broken. </p>

                <h3>PSP GO "N1000"</h3>
                <p>Radically changed from earlier PSP models, the PSP GO was certainly a one-of-a-kind for its time, despite its poor sales. Featuring a slide-out set of buttons similar to those keyboard phones, the complete lack of a UMD drive, a drastically reduced weight, a non-removable battery, 16 GB of internal storage, a proprietary charging port, and a very nice screen, it's safe to say it's very easy to identify a PSP GO. Introduces Bluetooth to the PSP line, and can connect to a DualShock 3 controller.</p>

                <h3>PSP-3000 "Brite"</h3>
                <p>Sony's second round of improvements for the PSP, and yet-again a welcome one. Most likely not as common as the earlier models, although they aren't hard to find in any sense. Easily identified by the bottom row's buttons being ovals (instead of half-circles), a small microphone near the “PSP” text, and the “HOME” button (bottom left) being changed to a PS (logo) button.</p>

                <h3>PSP Street "E1000"</h3>
                <p>With the Street being a budget-oriented model exclusive to the PAL countries, it comes as no surprise to know that the Street lacks several major features of the PSP and isn't found easily. Easily identified by its sleek bottom bar which has no prominent physical buttons. </p>

                <h3>PSP-2000 "Slim"</h3>
                <p>Sony's first update to the PSP, and a welcome one. Also a very common system, likely just as common as its predecessor model. Greatly improves upon the PSP-1000 in a large variety of areas. The 2000 is slimmer, lighter, doubles the RAM to 64MB (improving UMD loading and web performance), corrects the WLAN module issue, has a better screen with more accurate colors, and has a video-out feature not present on the 1000. </p>
